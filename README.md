## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```
## Building
To create a production version of your app:
```bash
npm run build
```
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
